Homework-10

Let's create a small contacts API.

Set your virtual environment

#Get your code. Use your assignment link.
git clone https://github.com/ITEC660/homework-10-profkemalaydin

#Create virtual environment

#Activate the env

#Install Django

#Fire up a new project. name:mycontacts

#Create your new app for your contacts API. ie: contactsapi
cd mycontacts
python manage.py startapp contactsapi

#Install Django REST Framework (DRF)
pip install django-rest-framework  django-cors-headers

Create a model and register it.

#Open the file contactsapi/models.py and edit:

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Contact(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=150)

***  +2.5 points for models.py changes

#Open the file contactsapi/admin.py and edit:
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Contact
admin.site.register(Contact)

***  +2.5 points  for admin.py changes


Register the app and the REST framework.

# Open the file mycontacts/settings.py and edit:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'contactsapi',
    "rest_framework",
]

Serialize the model. We can use DRF serializers.

#Create the file contactsapi/serializers.py and add the code below:
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Contact

class ContactSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Contact 
        fields = ('first_name', 'last_name')
Update the view

***  +2.5 points for serializers.py addition and changes

#Edit the file contactsapi/views.py:
from django.shortcuts import render
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .serializers import ContactSerializer
from .models import Contact

class ContactViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Contact.objects.all().order_by('first_name')
    serializer_class = ContactSerializer


***  +2.5 points for for views.py changes

Update URLs

# Edit mycontacts/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('contactsapi.urls')),

]

***  +2.5 points for for urls.py changes

# Go to contactsapi fodler
# Create a new file urls.py and add the following code:
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework import routers
from . import views

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'contact', views.ContactViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),    
]

***  +2.5 points for for contactsapi/urls.py addition and changes

Run migrations and add data


# Run your migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Migrate the model changes into the main database
python manage.py migrate

***  +2.5 points for presence of migrations

# Check if everything is passed, stated by an **… OK** ending

# create super user
python manage.py createsuperuser

# If you see the error below: 
# Superuser creation skipped due to not running in a TTY.
# You can try winpty
winpty python manage.py createsuperuser

# Serve the app
python manage.py runserver

#Open the admin site
