MVC stands for Model View Controller. MVC is a general framework for the separation of concerns. Templates are the View portion of that framework.

Templates are essential for maintaining complex and dynamic applications. They require significantly less time to build. Lists can be populated programmatically. Templates can be reused. Templates prevent SQL injection by escaping user data.

Let's setup a template. Create a folder named "templates" inside "mycontactsapp". Add the following content for "index.html" file.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">

<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href={% static 'styles.css' %} />
</head>
<body>

<h1>My Contacts</h1>
<p>This is only the first one:</p>
<p>{{contacts.0.first_name}}</p>
</body>
</html>

*** - 5 points for creation of file with head and body. Body will be replaced in stps to follow


Update views.py file so you can use contacts in the index.html.

*** - 5 points

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Contact

def index(request):
    #return HttpResponse('Hello World')

    # Display contacts
    all_contacts = Contact.objects.all()
    
    return render(request, 'index.html', {'contacts':all_contacts})


Run the website and check if the first contact name is displayed.

Please complete the following:
Add a for loop to display all contacts. This will be similar to v-for in Vue but using python and Django syntax. Please do your research and find a solution.
*** - 5 points

Add more users using the admin interface and make sure they are displayed on the website. (You can access admin interface via: http://localhost:8000/admin/)
*** - 5 points

Use {% load static %} inside index.html appropriately so it can reach the static files and use styles.css.
*** - 5 points

Update styles.css with your design. Change at least three properties.
*** - 5 points

Make sure you push your repository back with the working version of your code.
