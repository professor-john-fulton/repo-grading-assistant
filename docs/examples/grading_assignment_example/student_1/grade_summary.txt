1. Deductions
- None

2. Bonus Credit (if any)
- None

3. Strengths
- Authentication (register, login, logout) is implemented using Django’s auth system and correctly wired in the URL configuration. Full CRUD for posts and a functional search across both title and content are present and clearly organized in the views.

4. Areas for Improvement
- Consider associating posts with the authenticated user (e.g., a ForeignKey to User) and restricting edit/delete operations to the owner for better access control. Add explicit responsive layout techniques (media queries or a CSS framework) and ensure templates adapt well to small screens to improve user experience.

5. Score Summary
- Total: 60/60 points

6. Supportive Closing
Great work implementing all core features—keep building on this solid foundation!
